        An FAQ page that answers your customers’ most common and basic questions can reduce the volume of repetitive inquiries your customer support team has to deal with. It’s a proactive customer service initiative that allows your customer service team to focus on more critical support issues and respond faster to customers who need help with more complex problems.

        If your company already exists, then either in your inbox or your head of customer service’s inbox there will be a plethora of questions to get you started. Use these as a jumping-off point and make the list of questions as long as possible. No question is a dumb one, and odds are if one person thought it, then there’s a group of people out in the world thinking it, too. 

       If you are creating your business from scratch, jot down the questions that your friends, family, and investors ask about your product or service. Create a focus group and ask people to test your product or service and ask them questions about their experience. 

       Make sure the questions are relevant to your specific product and service and that they could make people want to buy once they find out the answer. Always frame your questions in a positive way.

        Determine common themes within your list of questions, and begin grouping them based on that commonality.
        Sifting through a long list of random questions will only further frustrate the consumer. Categorizing all of the questions will help guide them on their search for answers.

        They are called frequently asked questions for a reason. Make sure that all of the questions can apply to multiple people. 

        For instance, “What to do if my dog steals my underwear” would not be a good FAQ. A better FAQ would be about the product details and the quality of the fabric used to decrease the number of tears. 
        
        After you have the most popular questions nailed down, pick no more than five questions to highlight as the most popular or top questions at the beginning of your FAQ page. Emphasizing these questions will make for a better user experience because most shoppers will just need those answers.
